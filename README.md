### Cosmic ray detection with USB cameras, for the CREDO project
*Team project at the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw*

With CREDO Detector application simple smartphone with Android system can be changed into pocket particle detector (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08351). The application allows for collecting large amount of measurements from multiple users around the world and their global analysis. The goal of the project is to develope and test algorithms for particle detection in the camera sensor. To avoid limitation of the Android system, standard USB webcams connected to the computer can be used.  

The project includes developement of the code dedicated to cosmic ray event identification in the stream of camera frames, running tests with data collected using raioactive sources for different configurations of (webcam and algorithm) parameters, and the analysis of test data aiming at selection of the optimal running parameters. The final result of the project should be an application with simle interface allowing an unexperienced users to make observations with their webcams.
