*Cosmic ray detection with USB cameras, for the CREDO project (team project)*

### Test data

*Test data recording*

[Notebook](test_data_recording.ipynb) used for data recording was based on the 
[cosmic trigger](https://github.com/zarnecki/CREDO_webcam/blob/main/examples/cosmic-trigger.ipynb) 
and [video writing](https://github.com/zarnecki/CREDO_webcam/blob/main/examples/video_save_test.ipynb)
example notebooks. It was used to record test data sets for development of the cosmic event search algorithm.

*Test data samples*

Test data samples are available on the [Faculty of Physics cloud](https://mycloud.fuw.edu.pl/index.php/s/t2TndMJa9TAyBf3). 
Data collected with different webcams are shortly described below.

- **Targus** (model AVC05EU)

**Background sample**: 175795 frames captured in about 14 hours. 
190 events were found with on-line algorithm (while taking data). 
Only about 20 of these are true cosmic event, rest is due to noise.
Algorithm run on the stored data found much more (966) noise-like events.
File size: 1GB.

**Signal sample**: 15052 frames captured in 36 minutes with radioactive source (caesium 137).
339 events were identified on-line, 94% of which were also found on file recorded with H264 codec.
119 additional event (mostly with low significance) were found off-line (on recorded file).
File size: about 110MB.

Plots below compare highest pixel significance for on-line analysis and recorded data. 
Good agreement is found for events with high significance, no such events are lost due to compression.

- **Logitech** (Era)

**Background sample**: 51675 frames captured in about 9 hours.
34 events found on-line (while taking data), 29 in off-line analysis.
File size about 472 MB.

**Signal sample**: 10033 frames captured in 86 minutes with radioactive source (caesium 137). 
112 events found on-line, 102 events found off-line.
File size about 78 MB.

Frame rate is below 2 Hz. Camera has many hot pixels, as shown on the example even below (upper plot). 
Cosmic event signature is only visible after correcting for average pixel to pixel differences (lower plot); 
event is located at at position (604,371).

- **TITANUM**

"Darks" (frames taken with camera lens covered) are all zeros (in most frames)!

â†’ online threshold level lowered (Athr = 5.)

![Dark frame](titanum_flat.png)

**Background sample**: 270585 frames captured in about 12 hours (frame rate around 6 Hz).
814 events found (on-line). 
File size about 32 MB.

Events found mostly due to noise/readout errors (?) in the first image row:

But few cosmic events still visible, example below:

- Vakoss WS-3335

Very low level on "dark frame" (zero or single counts). 
Lower on-line threshold used (Athr = 5).

**Background sample**: 360900 frames captured in about 12 hours (frame rate about 8 Hz). 
Only 91 events found on-line (with lower threshold), 11 events with high significance threshold,
only 9 events in off-line analysis (with nominal thresholds).
File size about 1.6 GB.


Many low threshold events due to noise (?) in column 633. 
On-line event distribution on the sensor plane is shown below (open circles for low threshold, filled circles for higher one):
